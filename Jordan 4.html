    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    <p>The Air Jordan IV released in 1989 and was produced in four colorways throughout the year. Basically following the same colorway schemes as the Air Jordan III, the IV released in two white-based Bulls colorways (White/Cement and “Fire Red), one black-based colorway (Black/Red), and a white and blue accented version (Military Blue). It retailed for $100, making it one of the most expensive basketball shoes on the market at the time. But it was worth it, right?</p>
    <h2>The Tech</h2>
    <p>The Air Jordan IV may not have introduced any groundbreaking new technology to the basketball shoe world like many other Air Jordans, but everything it did have was functional and aesthetically pleasing. Already mentioned above, the IV brought back the mid-top height and visible Air, while other tech aspects of the shoe included additional Air in the forefoot, the supportive “wings”, a lacing system which provided multiple eyelets for custom lace placement, and the large heel pull tab for easy access. The “Bred” colorway also introduced soft nubuck leather to Air Jordans, a material that would be used on many following models.</p>
